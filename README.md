This program is an implementation of a Discord application designed to sign in through the use of Discord's development API.
It allow users who are in active voice channels to request playing audio via links to suppported media webhosting sites. 
The 'bot' will follow these links and download the media using the yt-dlp package, and then play the selected media in the voice call.
